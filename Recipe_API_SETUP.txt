Dev-Log. Creating a Flask Rest-API for Cooking Recipes SetUP.


Pre-Requesists:
I wrote this software a MacbookPro with M1 chip, however it should be universall for all UNIX based systems,
asside from package download/install may be diffrent on Linux-OS distributions:

Package-Manager:
Linux-distros:
I reccomend use of -apt- PM if on linux.
	--apt usually comes pre-installed on linux
I reccomend use of Brew PM if on OSX.
	--Install brew here: https://brew.sh/


*Python 3 Installed local machine
	-->install python3 on OSX: 
			verify its not installed already: $'python3 --version'
			download/install: $'brew install python3'
	--> install python3 on Linux-OS:
			verify its not installed already:$'python3 --version'
			download/install:' sudo apt-get install python3'
*Flask Installed local machine
	--> pip install flask (make sure you have pip installed first) 

{I prefer to install the packages globally under my user 
 first, verify their stability before then installing them within 
 the VE(virutal enviorment).
 This acts as a sanity check if you run into errors with the packages
 not functioning as desired within the VE}


1)Create a new Directory for your Application 'mkdir projectName'
2)Create a virtual-enviorment:  'pipenv --three' (python3)
	--$'pipenv shell' before installing packages: 
	a)install flask: 'pipenv install flask'
	
3)
